# Preprocessing steps

This section contains the preprocessing steps.

Details are contained as follows:

## [CGS computation](./cgs/)
- Step P1 (computation of the CGS)
- Step P2 (verification segments that will be used in inverse kinematic computation)
- Step P3 (re-arrangements of some Groebner bases for recursive computation)

## [Computation of the Hermite quadratic form](./hermite/)
- Step P4 (computation of the Hermite quadratic form and its characteristic polynomial)
