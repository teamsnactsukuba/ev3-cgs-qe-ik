# Verification of the existence of real points in the segments 

Let S_NN be the segment, expressed as
```
S_NN = V(<F_NN_1>) \ V(<F_NN_2>),
```
where 
* For I: an ideal, V(I) is the affine variety of I;
* <F_NN_1> is the ideal generated by F_NN_1 \subset Q[x,y,z], defined as in F-NN-1.rr; 
* <F_NN_2> is the ideal generated by F_NN_2 \subset Q[x,y,z], defined as in F-NN-2.rr.

Verification of the existence of real points in the segments are done as follows.

## Segments that contain real points

* There exists a point in V_R(<F_NN_1>) which does not belong to V_R(<F_NN_2>) (i = 00, 01, 02,)
* The descriminant or the QE computation to find that there exists a point in V_R(<F_NN_1>). 

## Segments that do not contain real points

* The only point(s) in V_R(<F_NN_1>) also exists in V_R(<F_NN_2>) (i = 03, 04, )
