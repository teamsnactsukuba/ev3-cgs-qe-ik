# Verification of the existence of real points in the segments 

Let S_NN be the segment, expressed as
```
S_NN = V(<F_NN_1>) \ V(<F_NN_2>),
```
where 
* For I: an ideal, V(I) is the affine variety of I;
* <F_NN_1> is the ideal generated by F_NN_1 \subset Q[x,y,z], defined as in F-NN-1.rr; 
* <F_NN_2> is the ideal generated by F_NN_2 \subset Q[x,y,z], defined as in F-NN-2.rr.

Verification of the existence of real points in the segments are done as follows.

## Segments that contain real points

* There exists a point in V_R(<F_NN_1>) which does not belong to V_R(<F_NN_2>) (i = 00, 01, 02)
* The descriminant or the QE computation to find that there exists a point in V_R(<F_NN_1>). 
Let G_{i,1} be a Groebner basis of <F_NN_1}> with respect to lex order with $x\succ y\succ z$, and, for f\in F_NN_2, the remainder of 
f divided by $G_{i,1}$ is not equal to zero (i = 05, 08, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 24, 30, 31)
* There exists a point in V_R(<F_NN_1>) and V_C(<F_NN_2>) is empty (i = 29)
* V_C(<F_NN_1>)=C^3 and the QE computation shows that there exists a real point which is not contained in V_R(<F_NN_2>) (i = 32)

## Segments that do not contain real points

* The only point(s) in V_R(<F_NN_1>) also exists in V_R(<F_NN_2>) (i = 03, 04, 16)
* There exists f \in F_NN_1 satisfying that the discriminant of f < 0 (i = 06, 07, 09, 11, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28)
* There exists f \in F_NN_1 with no real roots, founded by the QE computation (i = 15)
