# Verification of the existence of real points in the segments 

Let S_NN be the segment, expressed as
```
S_NN = V(<F_NN_1>) \ V(<F_NN_2>),
```
where 
* For I: an ideal, V(I) is the affine variety of I;
* <F_NN_1> is the ideal generated by F_NN_1 \subset Q[x,y,z], defined as in F-NN-1.rr; 
* <F_NN_2> is the ideal generated by F_NN_2 \subset Q[x,y,z], defined as in F-NN-2.rr.

Verification of the existence of real points in the segments are done as follows.

## Segments that contain real points

* V_C(<F_NN_1>)=C^3 and the QE computation shows that there exists a real point which is not contained in V_R(<F_NN_2>) (i = 35)

## Segments that do not contain real points

* There exists f \in F_NN_1 satisfying that the discriminant of f < 0 (i = 33, 34)
